YouTube's mobile app can attach a GIF to a comment; the desktop site has no button for it. Desktop GIFs adds one, next to the emoji button:

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/button.png" width="720" alt="The GIF button next to the emoji button in a comment box">
</p>

- **Everyone sees your GIF.** It is posted as an ordinary YouTube GIF comment, so viewers do not need the extension.
- **Write around it.** Pick a GIF, keep typing, then post with YouTube's own Comment button.
- **Search or paste.** Search Tenor, or paste a Tenor link.
- **Favorites.** Star the GIFs you use often and find them behind one button.
- **Nothing to set up.** No account, no API key, no tracking.

<sub>The screenshots show the extension's own interface on a test page that stands in for YouTube's comment box.</sub>

## Install

Desktop GIFs is not on the Chrome Web Store or addons.mozilla.org yet, so it is loaded from a ZIP. There is one for each browser on the [latest release](https://github.com/rayytor/desktop_gifs/releases/latest).

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/rayytor/desktop_gifs/releases/latest/download/desktop-gifs-chromium.zip"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Chrome%20%C2%B7%20Edge%20%C2%B7%20Brave-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=googlechrome&logoColor=white" alt="Download for Chrome, Edge and Brave"></a>
  <a href="https://github.com/rayytor/desktop_gifs/releases/latest/download/desktop-gifs-firefox.zip"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Firefox-FF7139?style=for-the-badge&logo=firefoxbrowser&logoColor=white" alt="Download for Firefox"></a>
</p>

### Chrome, Edge, Brave

1. Download [`desktop-gifs-chromium.zip`](https://github.com/rayytor/desktop_gifs/releases/latest/download/desktop-gifs-chromium.zip) and unzip it.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` and turn on **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and choose the unzipped folder, the one that has `manifest.json` directly inside it.

YouTube tabs that are already open get the button without a refresh.

Only Chrome is tested. Edge, Brave and other Chromium browsers should work the same way.

### Firefox

1. Download [`desktop-gifs-firefox.zip`](https://github.com/rayytor/desktop_gifs/releases/latest/download/desktop-gifs-firefox.zip). There is no need to unzip it.
2. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on…** and choose the ZIP.

YouTube tabs that are already open get the button without a refresh.

> [!NOTE]
> Firefox removes an add-on loaded this way when it closes. That is how Firefox treats every temporary add-on. Repeat steps 2 and 3 after a restart.

### From the source

The `extension` folder of this repository is the extension, and it loads in both browsers as it is: choose that folder in Chrome, or the `manifest.json` inside it in Firefox. Chromium browsers then list one harmless error about `background.scripts`; see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Use

1. On a video or a Short, click **Add a comment…** or **Reply**.
2. Click the **GIF** button next to the emoji button.
3. Click a GIF. It is attached to the comment box, below your text.
4. Write or edit your text, then click **Comment** (or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>).

The text in the comment box is posted together with the GIF. A comment can also be just the GIF. To take the GIF off, click the **×** in its corner; picking another GIF replaces it.

The picker opens with Tenor's featured GIFs. To find another one:

- type to search Tenor, or
- paste a Tenor link: a `tenor.com/view/…` page, a `media.tenor.com` file, or a bare Tenor ID.

To keep a GIF, point at it and click the star in its corner. The **★** button next to the search field shows your favorites; click it again to go back to the search. Click a favorite's star to remove it. Favorites are shared by all your YouTube tabs and are still there after a browser restart, in Firefox too, once the add-on is loaded again. Removing the extension from the browser deletes them.

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | In the search field, attaches the GIF when the picker shows exactly one, as it does after pasting a link |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> | In a comment box with a GIF attached, posts the comment |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Closes the picker |

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| No **GIF** button in the comment box | Refresh the YouTube tab. |
| "Not ready in this tab yet" | The tab was open before the install and the extension is still checking that it can post from it. Try again in a few seconds, or refresh the tab. |
| "The page hook is not running" or "The extension was reloaded" | Refresh the YouTube tab. |
| "The GIF was not sent" | YouTube did not send the comment. Press its Comment button again. |
| The post fails | Your text and the GIF stay in the box. Read the error before trying again. If the result is uncertain, check the comments first to avoid posting twice. |
| "YouTube rejected this GIF comment" | Read YouTube's explanation shown after the HTTP status. A rejection can concern the GIF, your account, the video or the request format. If every GIF fails, changing GIFs may not help. |
| "YouTube did not confirm this GIF comment" | YouTube's response did not confirm success. Check the comments before trying again; an unreadable response does not prove that nothing was posted. |
| "YouTube does not accept this GIF" in 0.1.4 or earlier | Those versions replaced several different YouTube errors with this message. Update to see YouTube's actual explanation; the message alone does not establish a GIF rating problem. |
| "YouTube only takes GIFs that Tenor rates G" | The link you pasted points at a GIF with another rating. Pick a different GIF. |
| "YouTube did not accept this GIF comment" | YouTube turned the comment down without giving a reason. Try another GIF or another video. |
| Search finds nothing in Firefox | Open `about:addons`, select Desktop GIFs, and check under **Permissions** that access to `tenor.com` is on. |
| "Manifest file is missing or unreadable" | The wrong folder was chosen. Choose the folder that has `manifest.json` directly inside it. |
| Chrome, Edge or Brave lists the error `'background.scripts' requires manifest version of 2 or lower` | The extension is installed and works. The message appears when the `extension` folder is loaded from the source; that key is there for Firefox. `desktop-gifs-chromium.zip` does not have it. |
| Clicking **GIF** does nothing in Firefox | Update to 0.1.1 or newer. |

If posting still fails, open the browser's developer tools and find **Desktop GIFs: comment not confirmed** in the YouTube tab's Console. The diagnostic includes the endpoint name, Tenor ID, whether text was included, HTTP status, API/action status and server explanation. It is also readable in Chromium's extension error list. Share those fields in a bug report, without request headers, cookies or a full network capture.

The selected GIF's ID and G rating are checked with Tenor before posting, including GIFs from favorites and unrated website fallback results. Version 0.1.8 removes the Android client retry tested in version 0.1.7, which also received HTTP 400 `INVALID_ARGUMENT` in live tests. Each submission sends one request using the page's own client, signing and comment/reply parameters. The intermittent rejection is still under investigation; this change does not establish a fix for it.

The extension enables the Comment button only to allow an empty GIF-only draft. With text present or a submission in progress, it preserves YouTube's validation and loading disabled states. Closing the reply dialog while the GIF is being checked cancels that submission.

In notification reply dialogs, the GIF picker stays inside the originating reply box so searching, using favorites or choosing a GIF does not dismiss the reply dialog. Pressing **Esc** closes the picker and returns focus to its GIF button.

## Limits

- **Unofficial.** This project is not affiliated with YouTube, Google or Tenor. It sends a field that YouTube's desktop site does not use itself, so it can stop working whenever YouTube changes something, and using it is at your own risk under YouTube's Terms of Service.
- **Tenor only.** YouTube's GIF comments take Tenor GIFs, so a GIF file from your computer cannot be posted.
- **G-rated GIFs only.** YouTube turns down every GIF that Tenor does not rate G, so the picker shows only those, and a pasted link to any other GIF is not offered.
- **Search depends on Tenor's website.** Tenor closed its public API in June 2026. Search and ratings come from the API that tenor.com itself uses, with the key its pages carry, and fall back to the results in Tenor's web pages, which have no ratings. Either can break when Tenor changes its site.
- **GIFs only.** Stickers and still images are left out of the results.
- **New comments and replies only.** You cannot add a GIF while editing a comment or writing a channel post.

## How it works

When you pick a GIF, the content script attaches it to the comment box. When you press Comment, it adds a one-time marker to the end of your text and lets YouTube's own Comment button go through. YouTube builds and signs the request as usual. The main-world script catches that request, removes the marker and adds the GIF's Tenor ID. A marker that cannot be turned into a GIF is blocked, so it never appears as comment text.

| File | Runs in | Job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/content.js`, `src/content.css` | YouTube page, isolated world | Adds the GIF button and the picker |
| `src/main.js` | YouTube page, main world | Rewrites the comment request so it carries the GIF |
| `src/sw.js` | Service worker (background script in Firefox) | Fetches G-rated search results from Tenor; on install, adds the two scripts above to YouTube tabs that are already open |

There is no build step and there are no dependencies: the `extension` folder is the extension. `python3 tools/package.py` writes the two release ZIPs, which are that folder with the other browser's background key taken out of the manifest.

Run `node --test tests/main.test.cjs tests/sw.test.cjs` with Node.js 22 or newer to check request handling and GIF verification against simulated responses. These tests do not publish comments or verify that a signed-in YouTube account can post a GIF.

For browser interaction regressions, install Python's `playwright` package and its Chromium and Firefox browsers (`python -m playwright install chromium firefox`), then run `python tests/picker.browser.py`. The fixture simulates notification reply dialogs, including capture-phase outside-click dismissal, transformed/scrolling containers and a native modal dialog. All Tenor results and posting acknowledgements are local test data.

## Privacy

- **YouTube and Tenor, nothing else:** `youtube.com`, where it adds the button, and for search `tenor.com` and Tenor's API at `tenor.googleapis.com`.
- **Nothing collected.** No analytics, no account.
- **Favorites stay in your browser.** They are kept in the extension's own local storage and are not sent anywhere.
- **Search goes to Tenor without your cookies**, and GIF previews load from Tenor's media servers.
- **Your YouTube credentials are never read.** YouTube's own page sends the comment.
